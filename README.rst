cve-check-tool
---------------

cve-check-tool, as its name suggests, is a tool for checking known
(public) CVEs. The tool will identify potentially vunlnerable software
packages within Linux distributions through version matching. Where
possible it will also seek to determine (through a distribution
implemention) if a vulnerability has been addressed by way of a patch.


``Branch 2``
============

``master`` has tons of useful code. There are library functions here that
will be reused in this cleanroom reimplementation, to allow a simpler and
more efficient, highly parallel, version of cve-check-tool.

This branch is to be used to reimplement the tool in a more modular and
extendible fashion. It does not necessarily mean we need to sport dynamic
loading of modules like before, however we should factor for multiple
data sources, introspection methods, etc.

Essentially, the core will be split out from the main binaries, allowing
various forms of interaction between various sources, outputs and matchers.

Previously re-implemented portions of code can now be sought from ``libnica``
to provide utilities and data types, as it is well tested and modular of it's
own accord. As a result, it is expected that ``libnica`` will develop new
features in tandem with this branch.
